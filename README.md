Hewwos!

## OwO, wat's dis?
The goal is to allow players to selectively disable in-game audio-visual effects that aren't strictly necessary to enjoy the game without changing game mechanics or balance. This may assist people who - among others; have photosensitivity, are sensitive to sensory overstimulation, or have limited computing resources. Effects can [usually] be toggled mid-stage.

Originally intended just my furiend group, I am now advertising it here on the Thunderstore because I believe everyone should be able to have some fun. If you don't like it/me being here, just remove it!

Currently only the following effects are configurable, but I'm always looking to add more options. If you know the asset address of an effect, or how to disable something else annoying then please feel free to [poke me](https://gitlab.com/lexxyfox/ror2-av-effect-options/issues) or even submit a PR.

Intended for headed client-side installations. [Should] have no effect on headless installations. 

### Currently configurable
* Brainstalks's screen effect
* Frost Relic particles and FOV change
* Gasoline's explosion
* Interstellar Desk Plant's indicator ward particle effects
* Kjaro's Band tornado
* Molten Perferators
* Runald's Band explosion
* Shatterspleen explosion
* Spinel Tonic's screen effect
* Sticky Bomb's drops & explosion
* Stone Titan's death effect
* Wandering Vagrant's death explosion
* Will-o'-the-Wisp explosion

### Future options
* Literally everything else
* Singularity Band
* Voidsent Flame
* Underwater screen effect
* Teleporter initialisation effect
* Imp boss effect
* etc.
* l10n support
* A new icon?

## Configuring
"Enabling" an effect (default) plays the effect as it does normally. "Disabling" makes it silent and invisible.
* Use [Rune580's Risk of Options](https://thunderstore.io/package/Rune580/Risk_Of_Options) (recommended)!
    ![Risk of Options](https://gitlab.com/lexxyfox/ror2-av-effect-options/wikis/roo.png)
* OR: modify the .cfg file manually...
    * You aren't required to run the game before doing this!
    * In BepInEx's config directory, create or modify the file named `.AVFX_Options...cfg`
    * Here's the default configuration to get you started...
