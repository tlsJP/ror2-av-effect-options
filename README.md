# Risk Of Rain 2 - AV Effects Options
This is a pseudo-fork of https://gitlab.com/lexxyfox/ror2-av-effect-options

## About
The goal is to allow players to selectively disable in-game audio-visual effects that aren't strictly necessary to enjoy the game without changing game mechanics or balance. This may assist people who, among others; have photosensitivity, are sensitive to sensory overstimulation, or have limited computing resources. Effects can [usually] be toggled mid-stage.

If you know the asset address of an effect, or how to disable something else annoying then please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/tlsJP/ror2-av-effect-options/issues) or even submit a PR.

Intended for headed client-side installations. [Should] have no effect on headless installations. 

### Currently configurable
* Blast Shower's effects
* Brainstalks's screen effect
* Frost Relic particles and FOV change
* Gasoline's explosion
* Interstellar Desk Plant's indicator ward particle effects
* Kjaro's Band tornado
* Molten Perferators
* Runald's Band explosion
* Shatterspleen explosion
* Spinel Tonic's screen effect
* Sticky Bomb's drops & explosion
* Stone Titan's death effect
* Wandering Vagrant's death explosion
* Weeping Fungus' effects
* Will-o'-the-Wisp explosion
* Plasma Shrimp AV effects


## Configuring
"Enabling" an effect (default) plays the effect as it does normally. "Disabling" makes it silent and invisible.
* Use [Rune580's Risk of Options](https://thunderstore.io/package/Rune580/Risk_Of_Options) (recommended)!
    ![Risk of Options](https://github.com/tlsJP/ror2-av-effect-options/blob/main/screenshot.png)
* OR: modify the .cfg file manually...
    * You aren't required to run the game before doing this!
    * In BepInEx's config directory, create or modify the file named `com.thejpaproject.AVFX_Options.cfg`
    * Here's the default configuration to get you started...
