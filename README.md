# Risk Of Rain 2 - AV Effects Options

This is a pseudo-fork of https://gitlab.com/lexxyfox/ror2-av-effect-options

## About

The goal is to allow players to selectively disable in-game audio-visual effects that aren't strictly necessary to enjoy the game without changing game mechanics or balance. This may assist people who, among others; have photosensitivity, are sensitive to sensory overstimulation, or have limited computing resources. Effects can [usually] be toggled mid-stage.

If you know the asset address of an effect, or how to disable something else annoying then please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/tlsJP/ror2-av-effect-options/issues) or even submit a PR.

Intended for headed client-side installations. [Should] have no effect on headless installations.

### Currently configurable

- Blast Shower's effects
- Brainstalks's screen effect
- Frost Relic particles and FOV change

## Notes

- Xamarin's xbuild is not compatible with this mod, and will not be supported by me. (msbuild > xbuild)
- This mod is **NOT** guaranteed to come with a virus.
- I'm not a .NET/C# developer, so there's a good argument to be made that I have no idea what I'm doing
